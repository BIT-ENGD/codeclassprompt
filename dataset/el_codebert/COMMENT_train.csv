If the AM releases containers matching * that profile, then the containers enumerated in {@link * PreemptionContract#getContainers()} may not be killed. * <p> * Each preemption message reflects the RM's current understanding of the * cluster state, so a request to return <em>N</em> containers may not * reflect containers the AM is releasing, recently exited containers the RM has * yet to learn about, or new containers allocated before the message was * generated. Conversely, an RM may request a different profile of containers in * subsequent requests. * <p> * The policy enforced by the RM is part of the scheduler. Generally, only * containers that have been requested consistently should be killed, but the * details are not specified.",11

"Implements a <i>dynamic Bloom filter</i>, as defined in the INFOCOM 2006 paper. * <p> * A dynamic Bloom filter (DBF) makes use of a <code>s * m</code> bit matrix but * each of the <code>s</code> rows is a standard Bloom filter. The creation * process of a DBF is iterative. At the start, the DBF is a <code>1 * m</code> * bit matrix, i.e., it is composed of a single standard Bloom filter. * It assumes that <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> elements are recorded in the * initial bit vector, where <code>n<sub>r</sub> <= n</code> (<code>n</code> is * the cardinality of the set <code>A</code> to record in the filter). * <p> * As the size of <code>A</code> grows during the execution of the application, * several keys must be inserted in the DBF. When inserting a key into the DBF, * one must first get an active Bloom filter in the matrix. A Bloom filter is * active when the number of recorded keys, <code>n<sub>r</sub></code>, is * strictly less than the current cardinality of <code>A</code>, <code>n</code>. * If an active Bloom filter is found, the key is inserted and * <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> is incremented by one. On the other hand, if there * is no active Bloom filter, a new one is created (i.e., a new row is added to * the matrix) according to the current size of <code>A</code> and the element * is added in this new Bloom filter and the <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> value of * this new Bloom filter is set to one. A given key is said to belong to the * DBF if the <code>k</code> positions are set to one in one of the matrix rows. * <p> * Originally created by * <a href=""http://www.one-lab.org"">European Commission One-Lab Project 034819</a>.",12
