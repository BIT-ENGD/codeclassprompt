Note that this cannot be done in the JSR223BeanInfoSupport class because that causes problems with the group; its properties are not always set up before they are needed. This cause various issues with the GUI: - wrong field attributes (should not allow null) - sometimes GUI is completely mangled - field appears at start rather than at end. - the following warning is logged: jmeter.testbeans.gui.GenericTestBeanCustomizer: org.apache.jmeter.util.JSR223TestElement#cacheKey does not appear to have been configured Adding the group here solves these issues, and it's also possible to add the key just before the script panel to which it relates.

"Some tables have pseudo column primary keys and others do not. JDBC on some DBMSs does not handle pseudo columns 'correctly'. Also, getTables returns 'views' as well as tables, so the thing we are looking at might not be a table. (JDBC does not give a simple way to determine what we are looking at since the type of object is described in a DBMS-specific encoding.)

"This is (a logically not sufficent) try to cope with the problem that there are the following contradictory rules in the JDBC API Doc: Statement.getResultSet(): This method should be called only once per result. Statement.getUpdateCount(): This method should be called only once per result. Statement.getMoreResults(): There are no more results when the following is true: (!getMoreResults() && (getUpdateCount() == -1) If getMoreResults() returns false, we don't know if we have more results, we only know that it isn't a result set. Since we called getUpdateCount() before getMoreResults() because we would like to know the update count of the first result, we might not be allowed to call getUpdateCount() again. The Intersystems Cache Driver for example always returns the same updateCount on simple INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements not matter if getMoreResults() was called. So updateCount never gets -1 and this will loop forever. When I discussed the issue with the Intersystems people they just told me not to call getUpdateCount() twice. That simple. My hope is that this will cure problems with DBs that just don't care for multiple result sets.",1

This forces the implicit join resolution to behave more like the classic parser. The underlying issue is that classic translator is simply wrong about its decisions on whether or not to render an implicit join into a physical SQL join in a lot of cases. The piece it generally tends to miss is that INNER joins effect the results by further restricting the data set! A particular manifestation of this is the fact that the classic translator will skip the physical join for ToOne implicit joins if the query is shallow; the result being that Query.list() and Query.iterate() could return different number of results!",1

Also, if either of these notifications (the actual model and the sortable model) are eliminated, it either throws an exception or does not update the GUI. Go figure.

"KLUDGE: We want some info about the columns to be available for validating the user input during cell editing operations. Ideally we would get that info inside the ResultSetDataSet class during the creation of the columnDefinition objects by using various functions in ResultSetMetaData such as isNullable(idx). Unfortunately, in at least some DBMSs (e.g. Postgres, HSDB) the results of those calls are not the same (and are less accurate than) the SQLMetaData.getColumns() call used in ColumnsTab to get the column info. Even more unfortunate is the fact that the set of attributes reported on by the two calls is not the same, with the ResultSetMetadata listing things not provided by getColumns. Most of the data provided by the ResultSetMetaData calls is correct. However, the nullable/not-nullable property is not set correctly in at least two DBMSs, while it is correct for those DBMSs in the getColumns() info. Therefore, we collect the collumn nullability information from getColumns() and pass that info to the ResultSet to override what it got from the ResultSetMetaData.",1

"Agency manages Critics. Since classes are not really first class objects in java, a singleton instance of Agency is made and passed around as needed. The Agency keeps a registry of all Critics that should be applied to each type of design material. When a design material instance is critiqued it asks Agency to apply all registered Critic's. In the current scheme there is a thread that proactively, continuously critiques the Design at hand, even if the user is idle! This is simple and it works. The disadvantage is that _all_ active critics related to a given design material are applied, regardless of the reason for the critiquing and a lot of CPU time is basically wasted. <p> TODO: I am moving toward a more reactionary scheme in which specific design manipulations in the editor cause critics relevant to those manipulations to be applied. This transition is still half done. Triggers are the critiquing requests.

The problem comes when the source db's precision/scale are greater - or reported to be greater - than the precision/scale of the destination db. In this case, it maximimizes both for the destination, causing a definition that allows 0 digits to the left of the decimal. Trouble is, without looking at the actual data, there is no way to tell if this is valid - in some cases it will be ok (0.0000000789) in others it will not be ok (100.123). So for now, make the scale be approx. one-half of the precision to accomodate the most digits to the left and right of the decimal and hopefully that covers the majority of cases.",1

(NameSpaces must be informed if the class space changes so that they can un-cache names). <p> Perhaps a simpler idea would be to have entities that reference cached types always perform a light weight check with a counter / reference value and use that to detect changes in the namespace. This puts the burden on the consumer to check at appropriate times, but could eliminate the need for the listener system in many places and the necessity of weak references in this package. <p>",1

"Sometimes the value can be retrieved at ""compile time"". If we succeed, nothing like it! We might not .. for the following reasons: 1. The constant is missing, 2. The reference is a forward-reference, 3. The constant's value is only known at run-time on first-access (but, this is runtime, isn't it??) 4. Our compiler isn't able to right away infer that this is a constant. SSS FIXME: 1. The operand can be a literal array, range, or hash -- hence Operand because Array, Range, and Hash derive from Operand and not Constant ... Is there a way to fix this impedance mismatch? 2. It should be possible to handle the forward-reference case by creating a new ForwardReference operand and then inform the scope of the forward reference which the scope can fix up when the reference gets defined. At code-gen time, if the reference is unresolved, when a value is retrieved for the forward-ref and we get a null, we can throw a ConstMissing exception! Not sure! //",1

"Delete a model element. Implements 'cascading delete' to make sure model is still valid after element has been deleted.<p> The actual deletion is delegated to delete methods in the rest of the factories. For example: a method deleteClass exists on CoreHelper. Delete methods as deleteClass should only do those extra actions that are necessary for the deletion of the modelelement itself. I.e. deleteClass should only take care of things specific to UmlClass.<p> The delete methods in the UML Factories should not be called directly throughout the code! Calls should always refer to this method and never call the deleteXXX method on XXXFactory directly. The reason that it is possible to call the deleteXXX methods directly is a pure implementation detail.<p> The implementation of this method uses a quite complicated if/then/else tree. This is done to provide optimal performance and full compliance to the UML 1.4 metamodel. The last remark refers to the fact that the UML 1.4 model uses multiple inheritance in several places. This has to be taken into account.<p> TODO: The requirements of the metamodel could probably be better determined by reflection on the metamodel. Then each association that a deleted element participates in could be reviewed to make sure that it meets the requirements and, if not, be deleted. - tfm<p> Extensions and its children are not taken into account here.

"PostgreSQL follows the standard for SQL BIT. It's a string of BITs. So bit(10) is a string of 10 bits. JDBC treats SQL BIT as if it were only a single BIT. It specifies that BIT is equivalent to BOOLEAN. It claims that the PreparedStatement set method that should be used with BIT is setBoolean and getBoolean. This is not compliant with the standard. So SQL BIT type support is broken in Java, there is nothing we can do about that. Best thing to do for now, is try to convert the BIT type to a boolean like the JDBC spec says and hope for the best. Hope that the source database isn't using the BIT column as a sequence of multiple BITs.",0
