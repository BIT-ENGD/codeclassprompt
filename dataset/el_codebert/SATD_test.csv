"1st step: As explained above, resizing an instruction may require to resize another one, which may require to resize yet another one, and so on. The first step of the algorithm consists in finding all the instructions that need to be resized, without modifying the code. This is done by the following ""fix point"" algorithm: - parse the code to find the jump instructions whose offset will need more than 2 bytes to be stored (the future offset is computed from the current offset and from the number of bytes that will be inserted or removed between the source and target instructions). For each such instruction, adds an entry in (a copy of) the indexes and sizes arrays (if this has not already been done in a previous iteration!) - if at least one entry has been added during the previous step, go back to the beginning, otherwise stop. In fact the real algorithm is complicated by the fact that the size of TABLESWITCH and LOOKUPSWITCH instructions depends on their position in the bytecode (because of padding). In order to ensure the convergence of the algorithm, the number of bytes to be added or removed from these instructions is over estimated during the previous loop, and computed exactly only after the loop is finished (this requires another pass to parse the bytecode of the method).",0

An update to one of those fields will look like we are replacing one row with an identical row (because we can only ""see"" the fields that we know how to do WHEREs on). Therefore, when we are updating them, there should be exactly one row that matches all of our other fields, and when we are not updating one of these special types of fields, there should be no rows that exactly match our criteria (we hope). We determine whether this field is one that cannot be used in the WHERE clause by checking the value returned for that field to use in the WHERE clause.

Remember that we might have multiple <join/> mappings associated with a single entity.

In all likelihood, just using the root table is much simplier 2) Need to add the FK columns corresponding to each joined table to the generated select list; these would then be used when iterating the result set to determine whether all non-optional data is present My initial thoughts on the best way to deal with this would be to introduce a new SequentialSelect abstraction that actually gets generated in the persisters (ok, SingleTable...) and utilized here.

Determine what sort of assigner should be used for the provided 'iter' (e.g. block). Assigner provides just the right logic for assigning values to local parameters of the block. This method also has a second optimization which is to set 'noargblock' in the case that the block is a block which accepts no arguments. The primary reason for this second optimization is that in the case of a yield with a RubyArray we will bypass some logic processing the RubyArray into a proper form (only to then not do anythign with it). A secondary benefit is that a simple boolean seems to optimize by hotspot much faster than the zero arg assigner.,0
